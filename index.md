### CPSC 120

Lab 2

Lab 2 was our first introduction to git clone and repositories, and it allowed me to experience github and the different tools that software programmers utilize firsthand. This lab opened my eyes to the world of github and allowed me to progress in my journey in computer science greatly. This lab also allowed me to truly grow my knowledge in computer science and set me on the path I am on today.

Lab 3

Lab 3 took all of the knowledge that we built up in previous labs utilizing clang, lint, push, pull, and commit and utilized it all in one singular lab. This was my first real introduction to programming and it made me fall in love with the process and the steps behind it. 

Lab 7 

Lab 7 part 2 was one of my personal favorite labs that we programmed because of the nature of the game blackjack. Me and my family have always played black jack together and being able to program it firsthand and seeing the functions that went into it fascinated me. Using the algorithms to create the blackjack game was truly fascinating.
